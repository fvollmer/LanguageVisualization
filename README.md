LanguageVisualization
=====================

This is an extension language for the Meta Programming System of MPS (http://www.jetbrains.com/mps). It can be used to show the structure of a language as UML class diagram.
For the visualization the PlantUML (http://plantuml.sourceforge.net) library is used. It is packed with the MPS PlantUML plugin which is shipped with the mbeddr project (http://mbeddr.com).
